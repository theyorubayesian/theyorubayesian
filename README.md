## theyorubayesian: Que sais-je? ·ªåÃÄr·ªçÃÅ p'√®s√¨ j·∫π.

I should start by saying `theyorubayesian` is a portmanteau of Yor√πb√° and Bayesian. I'm a software engineer operating at the intersection of distributed systems, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence.

## Machine Learning Operations

I started my career building and managing machine learning systems in on-premise and hybrid cloud environments for enterprises.
I have expertise in helping companies evaluate their machine-learning technical debt and production readiness.
I also help them achieve continuous integration, training, deployment, and monitoring goals.
In 2020, I was a technical mentor for Udacity, guiding professionals taking their [Azure Machine Learning Engineer NanoDegrees](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-for-microsoft-azure-nanodegree--nd00333), providing feedback on projects and helping them build an intuition of Azure's Machine Learning platform.
This role deepened my understanding of the challenges professionals and companies encounter when using machine learning in production.

### Advancing Technology for African Languages

My long-term goal is to advance technology that exists for African languages.
I believe in the transformative power of this goal for the continent.
I have used my web crawling experience to help develop test collections for [text classification](https://aclanthology.org/2023.ijcnlp-main.10/), [cross-lingual information retrieval](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626772.3657884) and to scale the [pre-training data available for 16 African languages](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.11/).
With [The African Research Collective (TARESCO)](https://huggingface.co/taresco), I am working on projects that are important for state-of-the-art technology for these languages to exist, including but not limited to language identification, speech transcription, optical character recognition to obtain data, and more.
Feel free to reach out to sponsor TARESCO or collaborate in this area :)
